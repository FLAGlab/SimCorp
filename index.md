In the following, we present the results for the different experiemnts conducted using the SimCorp Corpus

## Similitude Evaluation

In *[this](/web/sqamia2024.md)* experiment we evaluate the semantic similitude between programs using an approach based on programs' Control Flow Graf (CFG) using a neighbourhood approach and normalizing the weight of nodes with respecto their neighbour. This work is presented at the Software Quality Analysis, Monitoring, Improvement, and Applications ([SQAMIA'24](http://sqamia.org))
