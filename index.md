## Semantic Similarity Evaluation

In *[this](/web/iwsc2022.md)* experiment we evaluate the semantic similitude between programs using an approach based on programs' Control Flow Graf (CFG) using a neighbourhood approach and normalizing the weight of nodes with respecto their neighbour. This is put for consideration at the International Workshop on Software Clones ([IWSC'22](https://iwsc2022.github.io))
